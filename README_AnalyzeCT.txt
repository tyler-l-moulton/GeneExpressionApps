Analyze qPCR DATA -- README 

SUMMARY:

This app analyzes data for simulated qPCR experiments and is designed for easy use with data generated by the "Generate qPCR Data" app. Before uploading data to this app, copy and paste outputs of "Generate qPCR Data" into a single ".csv" file that can allow for comparison of multiple treatments (or species) and multiple genes. At least 2 genes and 2 treatments must be in the uploaded data or the app will not work. The app generates plots for qPCR fluorescence data and a heatmap-type graphic that shows relative expression of genes and treatments. Data tables (".csv" format) can be downloaded. Graphs can be downloaded by right clicking (or Cmnd + click) and saving as image. 




INPUT:

Choose CSV file		Choose a ".csv" file (preferably constructed with outputs of 
			"Generate qPCR Data" app). It must contain 2 treatment types
			and 2 genes (factorial design).

Subject or Individual	Select from the dropdown menu the header for the column specifying
			subjects or individuals within each treatment (or species).

Replicate or Trial	Select from the dropdown menu the header for the column specifying
			qPCR replicate or trial.

Log10 Fluorescence	Select from the dropdown menu the header for the column specifying
			log10-transformed fluorescence values from qPCR assays.

Treatment (or species)	Select from the dropdown menu the header for the column specifying
			treatment (or species).

Genes			Select from the dropdown menu the header for the column specifying
			the names of genes to be compared.

Cycles			Select from the dropdown menu the header for the column specifying
			cycle number for each qPCR assay.

Select Threshold	Specify the fluorescence threshold. The point where the Log10 
			Fluorescence values cross this threshold represents the CT 
			(threshold cycle) for each replicate of each subject.

Reference Gene		Select which gene name will serve as the reference (housekeeping) 
			gene for the relative expression calculations.

Baseline Treatment	Select which treatment (or species) name will serve as the baseline
Value			for the relative expression calculations.



BUTTONS:

Build Plot		Plots log10 fluorescence vs. cycle. Lines are color coded according to 
			gene. Line type (dashed, smooth, etc.) is coded by treatment. 
			If "Average by Subject" box is checked, then the log10 fluorescence 
			values of qPCR replicates for each cycle are averaged for each subject.

Download CT Data	Downloads a ".csv" file of the data. CT is given for each replicate of
			each subject for each gene and treatment. NOTE: Do NOT include "."
			or file extensions in File Name.
			Column headers are as follows:
			"treat", "gene", "SUBJECT", "REPLICATE", "ct", "Threshold"

Calculate Relative	Calculates the relative expression of each gene for each treatment by 
Expression		standardizing expression by the reference gene and comparing 
			expression to the "baseline treatment". This generates a heatmap
			that color-codes based on increase or decrease of relative expression.

Download Fold Change 	Downloads a ".csv" file of the relative epxression data.
			NOTE: Do NOT include "." or file extensions in File Name.
			Column headers are as follows:
			"treat", "gene", "SUBJECT", "mn.ct", "ref.ct",	"d.ct",
			"mn.ref.d.ct",	"dd.ct", "RelExpr"
			
			where:
			mn.ct 	    = mean CT of all replicates for each subject.
			ref.ct 	    = CT of the reference gene for each subject 
					under each treatment.
			d.ct 	    = DeltaCT (mn.ct - ref.ct)
			mn.ref.d.ct = Mean DeltaCT of subjects for each gene under
					the "baseline treatment"
			dd.ct	    = DeltaDeltaCT of each subject (d.ct - mn.ref.d.ct).
					  the average of these values should = approx. 0
					  for each gene in the "baseline treatment".
			RelExpr	    = Relative Expression (or Fold Change) calculated by
					2^-dd.ct.

Calculations of CT, DeltaCT and Relative Expression based on:
