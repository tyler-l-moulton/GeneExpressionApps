# GeneExpressionApps
These apps can be used to simulate data for a qRT-PCR -based gene expression experiment. They are built using Shiny. The sample data file included was created by running the GenerateCT app multiple times, adjusting the parameters each time to simulate the data as desired. The data were then copy and pasted into one large file which can be analyzed using the AnalyzeCT app. The scripts for these apps can be published or run locally. 
Remember to change names of app files to "app.R" before publishing.
